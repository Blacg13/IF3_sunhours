# SunHours ☀️

Welcome to SunHours (or "East to West" from its original name : "Est à Ouest" in French) ! 😀

This website provides you with precise sunrise and sunset times based on your geographical coordinates and the date you choose 🌞
It was my first project in HTML - CSS - JavaScript as part of a training program at Interface3 (Brussels, Belgium), after 3 and a half months of training 💪

Among the things I had in mind when making the mock-up of the site, there are still several functionalities to be added:

+ Responsiveness for screens over 600px wide 💻
+ Search with latitude and longitude formats other than decimal degrees (DMS, DMM and geohash) 🔍
+ Contact form ✉️
+ Improve the spinner animation 🛞
+ The ability to send or download search results on a pretty pre-created map (resembling the contact icon) ✨

In any case, I hope your stay here will be pleasant and functional !

## Technologies used
+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ JavaScript
+ VS Code
+ Photoshop (for the "contact" link icon in the navbar)
